<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am Poojan Vyas. I am a computer scientist and an engineer, currently working as an Engineer - Data &amp; Anlytics Development at SaskTel, Regina. I have a bachelors degree in computer engineering and a masters degree in computer science. I am also pursuing to become a professional engineer in association with APEGS Canada. Hence, I currently hold the title and license of Engineer-in-Training with SaskTel. I was born in Ahmedabad, India where I have spent majority of my life. In 2019, I immigrated to Regina SK, Canada to pursue my masters degree and I have been here since then.</p>
<p>I was always facinated by Artificial Intelligence ever since I watched Avengers: Age of Ultron. Even though people dislike it and call it a mid movie, I have always thought the portrayal of Ultron in the movie is clostest to real-life as exposing an AI (real AI and not the machine learning models that industries like to call AI) to the internet and human activities throughout history is the easiest way to human extinction. This fascination with AI made me pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence. This quest to AI research led me my current job where I have to use data and create machine learning and deep learning models. While I do not believe these models are any way close to a conscious AI, they allow me to learn more and more about how can machines think. So, expect some blogs on this topic in the future.</p>
<p>Apart from these professional details about me, I also love cooking. As an international student, I had to learn all the dishes my mum used cook to keep my stomach happy. I quickly developed a liking to the procedure of cooking which I found to be very relaxing and a way to escape the daily worries. Even after 4 years, I woldn&rsquo;t say I am a pro at it but I can confidently say that I won&rsquo;t have to starve or order food from restaurants. Few of my best dishes (according to my friends who are the only ones who have tried my food and didn&rsquo;t die) are Paneer Butter Masala, Pav Bhaji and Arrabiata Sauce Pasta. I <strong>MIGHT</strong> post the recipes for those here but I highly doubt about that. I have also started photography recently and got myself a DSLR just to capture the beauty of all the trails and places I frequently visit so definately expect few posts about some of my adventures.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-website-exist">Why does this website exist?</h2>
<p>I have developed several hobbies recently and I was wondering where to put all of my work, that&rsquo;s where this website comes in place as I thought a website would be a perfect place to store everything. So, expect some blogs on photographs I have taken, some coding blogs, cooking recipes etc. In short, this website will be a collection of everything I would like to share with others. I could have done this on my instagram account as well but I did not wish my account to turn into a mess and I also wanted to be mindful of not spamming people with content they did not wish to see. Besides, I have always thought of making my own website ever since I started coding during my bachelors degree but either I did not know how to do it or I simply did not have time/means of making and maintaing a website. However, now that I have settled down a little bit, I can finally work on the content during my free time or during weekends. I have no plans of getting my own domain name and making it public so it will only be accessible through my instagram bio where I have put a link to the website. However, you never know, I might change my mind and get a domain name any way so let&rsquo;s see.</p>
